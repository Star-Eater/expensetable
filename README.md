# expensetable

Heres something more down to earth. Although its a bit buggy in some aspects, I wanted to spend my time making other things. But this is the 2nd database project, except that its not just reading from a database. I can insert and delete stuff through the same app. and it comes with a pie chart from matplotlib.

Incase you ever run into this. The "Final" version is the one youre looking for. The rest of them are small scales or parts of the project i was trying to see how can i do this without affecting or dealing with unwanted errors while experimenting.
